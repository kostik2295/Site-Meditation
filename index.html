						However, a prolonged state of such arousal can lead to physical damage to every part of the body.<br></br>

						Meditation affects the body in exactly the opposite way than stress â€” causing the body to react to relaxation. 
						It puts the body in a calm state, helping it to repair itself and preventing new damage from the physical effects of stress. 
						It can calm your mind and body by suppressing stress-induced thoughts that support your body's response to stress.

			    	<h2>How did this happen?</h2>
			    	<p>The ancient practice of meditation has been used by civilizations around the world to calm and focus the mind on improving physical and mental well-being. 
						With the help of various techniques and approaches, you can find this calm, calming and relaxing meditation - a practice that millions of people implement into their daily lives.
						<br></br>
						Where did meditation come from? Scientists suggest that meditation dates back to hunter-gatherers in the Indus River Valley around 5,000 years BC
. They were depicted practicing meditative practices. Throughout history, almost all world religions have developed some form of meditation, which made it difficult to determine its exact origin. 
						Modern meditation practices in India are usually attributed to Buddhism.
						<br></br>
						The long and widespread history of meditation suggests that societies and religions around the world have come to see meditation as an important factor contributing to their belief systems and well-being. 
                    	Early meditation was closely linked to religion, providing a deeper spiritual connection between individuals and communities. Today, meditation is practiced outside of its religious roots, becoming
a ritual that has been proven to produce positive health results.
						There are many types of meditation that need to be learned</a> as well as the opportunity to study and become a certified meditation teacher.
						<br></br>
						Meditation focuses more on spirituality and inner awareness than on following a particular belief system or doctrine. 
						It is clear that prayer and meditation are based on similar practices and goals, but they do not depend on each other.
