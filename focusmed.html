                    <h2>Focused Meditation</h2>
                    <p>Focused meditation is a technique that allows us to focus on a single object or focus point in order to reduce mental noise and deepen our presence in the present moment. During the practice of focused meditation, we choose an object of attention, for example, our breath, sound or mantra, and direct our attention and awareness to it.The main purpose of focused meditation is to eliminate distracting thoughts and experiences that may arise in our mind. When we learn to focus on one object, we train our mind to be in the present moment and be more aware and present.</p>
