                        <h2>Transcendental meditation</h2>   
                        <p>Transcendental meditation (TM) is a special meditation technique that uses the repetition of a mantra to achieve a state of deep relaxation and peace. TM was developed in the 1950s by the Indian meditation teacher Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and has since gained wide recognition and popularity.During TM practice, you sit down in a comfortable position, close your eyes and begin to repeat the mantra quietly. A mantra is a special word or phrase that represents a sound vibration. It is important to note that the mantras used in TM are personal and are transmitted by the meditation teacher to each practitioner individually.</p>

                            <li>Stress and Anxiety Reduction: TM is known for its ability to reduce stress and anxiety levels. During TM practice, the body experiences deep physiological relaxation, which helps to reduce the production of stress hormones and creates a feeling of calm and well-being. This allows you to effectively cope with everyday stressful situations and improves your overall mental state.</li>
                            <br>
                            <li>Improving Physical and Mental Health: Regular TM practice can lead to lower blood pressure, improved heart function and immune system. It also helps to strengthen the nervous system, increase energy and improve the quality of sleep. TM gives the body the opportunity to recover and relax, which has a beneficial effect on the overall physical condition.</li>
                            <br>

                            <li>Increasing creativity and intuition: TM promotes the disclosure of the potential of creative thinking and the development of intuition. Thanks to deep relaxation and the elimination of mental noise, new ideas and insights arise. You can better understand yourself and your internal processes, which helps you make more thoughtful and intuitive decisions.</li>
